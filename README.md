📌 Project Description The Housing Register DApp is a decentralized registry built on the Flare Coston2 Testnet that allows users to register houses on-chain. Each house entry stores the location, price, and owner address and is permanently recorded on the blockchain.

This project demonstrates how to interact with a deployed smart contract using:

Wagmi + Viem Next.js Flare network Events & Write/Read contract calls The system provides transparency, immutability, and public verifiability for housing records.

⭐ Features

Add a House (Write Function) Anyone can register a house by entering: Location (string) Price (number) Automatically stores sender as the owner.
Retrieve Total Houses View the total number of houses registered on-chain.
Fetch Individual House Details For each house, the contract returns: id location price owner address
UI Integration Wallet gated Loading + pending + confirmation states Transaction hash + success indicator Error handling included 🧩 How This Project Solves the Problem Traditional housing records are centralized, fragile, and often lack transparency. The Housing Register DApp solves these issues by using blockchain technology:
✅ Immutability Housing records cannot be manipulated once registered.

✅ Decentralization No central authority controls the data — all records are publicly verifiable.

✅ Ownership Transparency Each house is permanently linked to an on-chain wallet address.

✅ Public Auditability Anyone can verify:

Price data Owner address Historical entries Use Cases Proof of property listings Transparent government registries Real estate portals Rental marketplaces Data verification systems This project provides a clean foundation for building more advanced property management systems, including renting, selling, verifying documents, or adding metadata such as images or legal records.
